# Instructions

This application follows the MVC design pattern


## Requirements
 - PHP 7 and above
   - PDO
 - MySQL server

 To test the application you must populate the database first. The data is included in the **data** folder: there are two files, one containing data to be inserted in the **usuarios** table and the other containing data to be inserted in the **numeros**.

 Alternatively, the files containing the query to create and populate both tables are included in the **data/tables** folder.

 **Server must be run from root directory, NOT from public folder.**
